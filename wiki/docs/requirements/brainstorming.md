## Why

Growing your Twitter Account is a really lucrative way to create potential passive income, increase networking opportunities and more.

We could also sell the software as a service and make it available for other people to use it.

There is a pretty successful market for selling Twitter Growth Hacking Guides ranging from $0-$50 per guide. Each guide has a lot of the same information, and regardless they continue to sell consistently.

Making a twitter growth bot is a way to automate and increase the earning potential of our twitter accounts. We can repplicate automation tools such as hyperfury and buffer.

And by making a system we can replicate the process and sell the solution to other accounts.

## What problem are we solving

The main problem with these guides is that the implementation of the techniques in the guides is not always successful, and takes at least 1-3 hours of commitment per day to successfully grow your account to a size that will lead to success.

Therefore, creating an automated solution is ideal, to help save time, and generate the results that people really want. All of the guides that are currently available can easily be synthesized into their simplest components, most of which can be automated.
