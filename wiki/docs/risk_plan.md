# Risk Planning

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain how the risk analysis plan took place.

The objective is to predict how all expected risks will be identified, quantified, qualified, maintained and controlled.

In case something goes wrong in the process, we can go back at this document and choose which risks are we going to take in order to change the results.

## Analytical Structure of the Risks

![analytical structure](/img/risk_mapping_diagram.jpg)

### Description of each Items

#### Project management

- **Planning**: related to planning, such as large tasks in short periods.
- **Estimation**: relate to estimation, such as errors in delivery prediction.
- **Verify**: related to the lack of action.

#### Organizational

- **Human Resources**: communication or lack of parties involved.
- **Prioritization**: focus. The one thing.
- **Productivity**: the commitment of the development team

#### Technical

- **Requirements**: Risks related to the requirements raised and the defined scope.
- **Technology**: Risks related to the technologies and tools used in the project.
- **Infrastructure**: One of the most critical points of risk management in software projects, as we usually forget to provide in advance the infrastructure where the software will run. It involves the whole question of architecture, definition of technology.

#### External

- **Market**: Competition risks. Low user attraction, or evolution of the project in the market.  
- **Customer**: It concerns the risks related to the customer, such as approval of the solution, good acceptance and adherence.
- **Environment**: The environment can influence team performance and product development. Remote work can carry several risks.

#### Quality

- **Functionality**: Includes everything related to the functionality of the software.
- **Usability**: Usability encompasses all aspects related to the interface with ease and accessibility.
- **Efficiency**: Ensure that the is able to have the application's responses quickly and cohesively.
- **Portability**: Refers to which platforms / operating systems the software will run on and how the compatibility will be made.
