# Methodology

To organize the project, agile methodologies were adopted.

One of the used methods are Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.

We will use this to track de advancement of the project.

## Sprint planning

A Sprint planning document will be produced for the beggining of each Sprint.

In the planning document, it will be shown:

    - Issues to be developed and those responsible
    - A meeting report containing the main decisions
    - Delivery dates
    - Any notes relevant

***

## Sprint Review

A Sprint review document will be produced for the end of each Sprint.

In the review document, it will be shown:

    - Issues delivered
    - Technical debts, if any
    - General observations on the result achieved
    - Link to recordings made, if any

***

It's important to notice that we will hold meetings at the beginning and end of each sprint in order of maintaining the constant progress of the project.

Estimating for a sprint, deciding on the sprint, and focusing on those objectives.
